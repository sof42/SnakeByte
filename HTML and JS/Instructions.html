			<li class="orderedlist">Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake around the playing field. Your goal is to collect as many points as possible by eating the food that appears randomly on the screen.</li>
			<li class="orderedlist">As the snake eats the food, it will grow longer. Be careful not to let the snake touch the walls or its' own body, or it will die and the game will be over.</li>
			<li class="orderedlist">You score is displayed at the top of the game page. Once you reach a certain score, the game will become more difficult and therefore faster.</li>
			<li class="orderedlist">Keep an eye of your score. Try to beat your highest score!</li>
			<li class="orderedlist">The game is OVER when the snake collides with a wall or its' own body.</li><br>
